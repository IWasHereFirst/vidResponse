# Response to tip nr. 7
# Being programmer might be a lonely activity
# This might not be a completely true. We should compare similar jobs with learning curves.
# Well let's take for example like doctors and scientists... When we read the documentation,
# they read the books or some reports too... But when they operate, or "make science" then they socialize a bit.
# But as in tip nr. 6 stands... we should collaborate and sure you can do it online, but no-one said there can't
# be one extra chair to your left or right, or having a code conversation with your friend and some beer on the table.
# So I disagree on that.
